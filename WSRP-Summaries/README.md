Also feel free to make any styling changes you wish in the styles.css file, 
but if you do, send it back to me with the changes.

NOTE: Important tags you can use:
	-The <code> makes whatever text is inside it use the browser's 
	monospace font so it is easy to distinguish as computer code (you can see this used in the sql html file)
	-The <img src=PATH> tag is used to insert images (also used in the sql html file)
