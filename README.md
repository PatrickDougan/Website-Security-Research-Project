**USER INSTRUCTIONS**
First, you will want to navigate to our main index website, which is located at: <BR/>
  http://ec2-34-210-43-2.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/

You will see a introduction to our project, along with a side menu which links to each exploit we implemented: 

You can click through and explore each of the attacks as you please. Each attack has a demonstration section which links to an external, deliberately vulnerable web application to showcase the exploit first hand. Some attacks also have a fixed version of the web application where the exploit is no longer possible.
