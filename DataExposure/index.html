<h1>Sensitive Data Exposure</h1>
<BR>

<P>Sensitive data is any information that's meant to be protected against unauthorized access. Data exposure happens when data is left unencrypted in a database or server accessible to anyone. Sensitive data are often exposed when configuration details for systems and applications are left unsecured online. Sensitive data can include anything from personally identifiable information (PII), like social insurance numbers, to banking information, to login credentials. When this data is accessed by an attacker as a results of a data breach, users are in danger for sensitive data exposure. Data breaches that end in the exposure of sensitive credentials can include costs within the millions of dollars, destroying a company's reputation along with it.</P>
<P>Sensitive data exposure occurs when a web application, company, or other entity mistakenly exposes personal data. It occurs as a result of not adequately protecting a database where information is stored. This could be a result of a large number of things like weak encryption, no encryption, software flaws, or when someone mistakenly uploads data to an incorrect database.</P>
<P>Data exposure is often linked to how an organization handles certain information. Sometimes, sensitive data are often found stored in plain text documents. If websites don't use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and don't have HTTPS security on sites that store information, data is also in danger of being exposed.</P>


<H2>Data in Transit:</H2>
<P>Data transmitted over a network is known as data in transit. Data is usually on the move, sending commands and requests across networks to other servers, applications, or users. Data in transit is extremely vulnerable, especially when moving across unprotected channels or to the application programming interface that permits applications to communicate with each other. As an example, once you browse the web, you generate HTTP traffic which carries data between you and also the target server. Because it's in motion, this sort of data is often targeted in many ways.</P>

<H2>Data at Rest:</H2>
All data which doesn't move within the network is at rest. This includes archives, backup files, databases, etc. It's thought to be less vulnerable without the threat of attacks in passing, but more valuable. Well, an attacker can access it through an absence of authentication, poor access control on a repository, etc.
<p>Attackers use different methods to get hold of this data, often using malware like Trojan horses or computer worms. Both of those gain access into system data through direct downloading from a malicious USB drive or by clicking malicious links that are sent via email or instant message. If data is housed in a server, attackers could get ahold of information stored in files outside of the traditional authenticated areas of access. This increases the probability of a directory traversal or path traversal attack.</P>

<H2>How to avoid Sensitive Data Exposure:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Always encrypt sensitive data, even when it’s in transit form, especially after you are storing it. For extra sensitive data, try limiting its accessibility to only one or two of authorized users with separate private keys (in case of encryption).
<LI>Weak passwords result in easy security breaches. To get strong passwords, you may use the hashing function algorithm. With that, it’s advised to alter your passwords regularly and maintain a unique password for each different platform.
<LI>Risk levels to sensitive data change with time. it’s recommended to regularly monitor and conduct a risk assessment for any potential threat for your sensitive data.
<LI>During an information theft, the utmost losses occur due to no proper backup of data. Maintaining a secure and guarded backup would facilitate your to reduce the losses.
<LI>It’s important that you just have secure authentication gateways. With the utilization of advanced standard security, like SSL and TSL, you can make sure that the information flowing between a web browser and a web server isn’t only encrypted but also remains private. Additionally, HTTPS offers secure communication protocol for the applications using it.
